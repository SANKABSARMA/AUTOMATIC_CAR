AUTONOMOUS CAR using Arduino and Bluetooth Module (HC-05)

IMPORTANT STUFF: Arduino, Motor Driver IC(L293D), 9V Battery, Chassis, 2 180RPM Motors, HC-05 Module.

DESCRIPTION: The communication between smart phone and HC05 is through bluetooth and the communication between Arduino and HC-05 is UART communication.
Based on input commands using smart phone it generate a HEXADECIMAL value and put this in if-else condition and based on which speed of motor is being controlled.
Apart from using input keypad it can also be made voice controlled.The procedures is same as used for keypad control.
The code is uploaded for reference.
